Diabetes Prediction using Python: Exploratory Analysis and Machine Learning

Diabetes Prediction using Python is a project aimed at developing an accurate model for predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals. 
The project incorporates various techniques, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and the integration of two simple machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression to test the accuracy score of the prediction

The variables considered for the prediction model include 'Pregnancies', 'Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Skin Thickness', 'Insulin', 'BMI', 'Diabetes Pedigree Function', 'Age', and 'Outcome'. These variables are important factors in assessing the risk and likelihood of diabetes in individuals.
